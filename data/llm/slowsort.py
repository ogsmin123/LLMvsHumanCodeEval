def slowsort(arr, i, j):
    # Base case: If the array has one or no elements, it's already sorted
    if i >= j:
        return

    # Calculate the midpoint of the current subarray
    m = (i + j) // 2

    # Recursively apply slowsort to the first half
    slowsort(arr, i, m)

    # Recursively apply slowsort to the second half
    slowsort(arr, m + 1, j)

    # Compare and swap the last element of the current subarray with the maximum
    if arr[j] < arr[m]:
        arr[j], arr[m] = arr[m], arr[j]

    # Recursively apply slowsort to the entire subarray
    slowsort(arr, i, j)

# Example usage:
# arr = [4, 3, 2, 1]
# slowsort(arr, 0, len(arr) - 1)
# print(arr)  # Output will be a sorted array [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

This implementation of slowsort follows the humorous nature of the algorithm, which is intentionally inefficient. The algorithm recursively sorts the first half and the second half of the array, then compares the maximum of the two halves with the last element and swaps if necessary, and finally recursively sorts the entire array again. This results in a highly inefficient sorting process, which is the intended joke of the algorithm.
